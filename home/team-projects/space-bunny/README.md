## Game Description

Space Bunny is a single-player, **physics-based platformer**. The game exists in a **zero-gravity** space environment, following the Bunny protagonist who is looking to recover their carrots. On a delivery mission, Bunny‚Äôs ship encountered a meteor shower that caused major damage to the ship, including the cargo containers, which resulted in the carrots being released into space.

The player‚Äôs goal is to help the Bunny explore the space around the ruins of their ship, navigating by latching onto meteors with their space lasso. As Bunny is in a constant state of motion, latching onto a meteor allows the bunny to rotate around the object, gaining the ability to change direction of travel, as well as align with nearby carrots. The game enforces quick decisions and precision to successfully advance through the levels.

## Team-based Postmortem

### What Went Well

* Good communication about when collaboration or help was needed from other specialty
* Good contribution from all disciplines
* Build checklist for quality assurance
* Strong organization helped us achieve tasks on time and leave ample time for playtesting

### What Went Wrong

* May make some changes but not inform others of what changes were made
* Sometimes perforce comments are too simple and not helpful if wanting to go to previous version
* Underestimate time that is needed for documentation and team has to start crunching
* Need to use more mild language and be more decisive
* Sometimes got stuck on certain topics or subjects during game planning and brainstorming

### Even Better If

* Create game metrics document - having something that is right there everyone con look at
* Submit after completing a task - do not wait and submit a lot of tasks
* Keep practicing at timeboxing and give cushion to go back and double-check
* Listen to other people and practice
